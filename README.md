# PingPlot Version 1.0

PingPlot is a Python script which pings a given host and records the latency of each ping as a function of time.  When you choose to stop, a plot is generated showing your latency to the host as a function of time since the startup of the program.  It utilizes numerous Python libraries and especially takes advantage of Matplotlib and Numpy

If you experience a timeout (100% packet loss) for a certain amount of time, the plot shows a red-shaded area across the times your connection to the host was down.  This may be useful in diagnosing network connection issues, both client and server side.

PingPlot is meant to be run as a command line program. The run arguments/options are listed below.  If you wish to run this program from Windows, create a shortcut, right click on it, scroll down to properties, and then append any of the options/arguments below to the target field.  To run the program with these arguments, just run the shortcut.

For convience, I have included a Windows installer, which will allow one to run the program as a binary. You can download the installer from the [downloads section on the GitHub repo](http://github.com/downloads/ccampo133/PingPlot/pingplot_v1.0_setup.exe).

If you have any questions/comments, please feel free to email me at [ccampo.progs@gmail.com](mailto@ccampo.progs@gmail.com) or through my github page, github.com/ccampo133.

This application was inspired by [PingPlotter](http://www.pingplotter.com/), which is basically a more robust version of this software.

    Usage: pingplot.exe (or .py) [options]

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -p, --plot            generates plot after data collection is finished
      -f, --file            save plot to file in the current directory
      -H HOST, --host=HOST  the url or ip address to ping [default: google.com]
      -n N, --num=N         the number of packets to send on each ping iteration
                            [default: 1]
      -t DT, --dt=DT        the time interval (seconds) in which successive pings
                            are sent [default: 0.5 s]
      -l, --log             save a logfile of the event in the current directory
      -s SIZE, --size=SIZE  If plotting/saving a plot, this is the plot's
                            dimensionsin pixels (at 80 DPI) in the format XxY
                            [default: 1280x640]
