PingPlot Version 1.0
=====================

PingPlot is a Python script which pings a given host
and records the latency of each ping as a function of
time.  When you choose to stop, a plot is generated
showing your latency to the host as a function of time
since the startup of the program.

If you experience a timeout (100% packet loss) for a 
certain amount of time, the plot shows a red-shaded area 
across the times your connection to the host was down.

This may be useful in diagnosing network connection 
issues, both client and server side.

This application was inspired by PingPlotter 
(http://www.pingplotter.com/), which is basically a
more robust version of this software.

PingPlot is meant to be run as a command line program.
The run arguments/options are listed below.  If you wish
to run this program from Windows, create a shortcut,
right click on it, scroll down to properties, and then 
append any of the options/arguments below to the target
field.  To run the program with these arguments, just
run the shortcut.
